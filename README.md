## Introduction

Morpheus Asia is a builder on the [Morpheus Network](https://mor.org), managing a builder pool with the mission of growing the Morpheus community across Asia. We focus on education, tools, and initiatives to expand adoption and support builders in and around Asia. This repo outlines how to contribute to our website at [morpheus.asia](https://morpheus.asia) and answers common questions for anyone looking to get involved.
## FAQ
**What is Morpheus?**
Morpheus is a decentralized AI network that incentivizes builders, capital providers, coders, and compute contributors to collaborate in creating a peer-to-peer ecosystem, powered by the MOR token. Builders can create communities like Morpheus Asia and applications like Smart Agents and dapps. Capital providers can basically stake their stETH with the Morpheus network for a potentially higher return on their ETH compared with regular staking. Coders can contribute to the codebase and get compensated in MOR. Compute providers can offer hardware resources that users can pay for using the MOR token. All earn MOR rewards based on their contributions' usage and impact. The MOR20 Platform supports a fair token launch model, with over 320,000 staked ETH, 6,500+ capital providers, and $5.5 million in protocol-owned liquidity, driving the network's growth and adoption.
