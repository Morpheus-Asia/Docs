## FAQ
**What is Morpheus?**
Morpheus is a decentralized AI network that incentivizes builders, capital providers, coders, and compute contributors to collaborate in creating a peer-to-peer ecosystem for general-purpose AI, powered by the MOR token. Builders can create communities and applications like Morpheus Asia, smart agents, and dapps, capital providers supply stETH liquidity, coders contribute to the codebase, and compute providers offer hardware resources, all earning MOR rewards based on their contributions' usage and impact. The MOR20 Platform supports a fair token launch model, with over 320,000 staked ETH, 6,500+ capital providers, and $5.5 million in protocol-owned liquidity, driving the network's growth and adoption.

**Can anyone contribute to the morpheus.asia website?**
